      <p class="top-text">
        Gardening may be a fun and relaxing way to get in touch with nature, but
        did you know that it also has plenty of health benefits? Gardening is an
        activity that is good for both the mind and body, and can be enjoyed by
        people of all ages. Plus, you get to eat the delicious fruits,
        vegetables and herbs that you grow. So, grab your tools and get in the
        dirt! It only takes a little bit of gardening to work up a sweat.<br />
        According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just 2.5
        hours of moderate activity each week can help reduce the risk of many
        health problems, including heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure
        and Type 2 diabetes.

      <h2 class="heading2">Listening Music</h2>
      <p class="middle-text">
        Listening to music is a hobby because it can be very relaxing and
        enjoyable. According to Scientific American, listening to music helps
        reduce stress and anxiety, improves mental functions like memory and
        reasoning, promotes cardiovascular health, increases pain tolerance,
        reduces depression which improves mood. It also boosts the immune
        system, improves sleep and has been proven to have a positive effect on
        the body. <br />It is also been proven that listening to music can help
        individuals focus better. According to a book called Music and Work: The
        Science and Psychology of Working in Groups , by Dominic Heale, music is
        a source of stimulation for the brain which can be a great thing if you
        need to study or get your work done. It helps promote attention and
        focus so you are able to concentrate on what you are doing more
        effectively.

      <h2 class="heading3">Drawing</h2>
      <p class="last-text">
        Drawing, or art in general, is an excellent option for a new quarantine
        hobby to fight boredom. Drawing is not only calming, but it also hones
        beneficial skills and psychological benefits via art therapy. Art
        therapy is rooted in the idea that creative expression can foster
        healing and mental well-being. Art, including drawing, can help you
        escape from reality and express unpleasant feelings you may have trouble
        putting into words.
